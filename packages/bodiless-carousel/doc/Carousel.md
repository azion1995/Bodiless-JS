# Carousel Component

The Carousel is a component that allows you to create a slideshow. The Carousel
can be used to display a number of things that may be of interest to site
viewers. These may include customers, features, or individuals.

A basic Carousel contains images. You can add text via a Rich Text box next to
a Carousel. Each image object contains only the image, alt text, and the image title.

### Add Images to Carousel

Add an image to the slide by clicking on the placeholder image. Then, click
on the "Image" button on the tool bar. This calls up the Image menu. Under "src,"
enter the path to the image (usually `/images/imagename.png`). You can also add alt
text or a title for the image. You can also drag a file to the image menu to
upload it to your site.
